"""URDF post-processing helpers shared across simulator and MoveIt launches.

Lives in ``genie_sim_robot_model`` because that package is a dependency of
both ``genie_sim_bringup`` (which publishes the simulator's URDF on
``/robot_description``) and ``genie_sim_moveit`` (which loads its own URDF
through ``MoveItConfigsBuilder``).  Keeping the helper here avoids a
``bringup → moveit`` or ``moveit → bringup`` dependency loop while letting
both call sites apply the same transformation to the URDF string.

    """Widen ``<limit lower=.. upper=..>`` on every URDF joint by a small pad.

    Why: MuJoCo's joint limits are soft (Baumgarte-stabilised impulse
    constraint), so the simulated joint can drift past the URDF limit by
    a fraction of a degree under heavy contact load.  MoveIt 2's
    ``CheckStartStateBounds`` adapter then rejects planning requests
    with errors like::

        Joint 'idx61_arm_r_joint1' from the starting state is outside
        bounds by: [-3.07236] should be in the range [-3.0718] [3.0718].

    The overshoot is sub-mrad in practice -- well below anything the
    planner needs to respect -- but the rejection blocks every grasp
    attempt that lands the arm near a hard stop.  MoveIt's
    ``start_state_max_bounds_error`` only feeds the *Fix*StartStateBounds
    adapter; ``Check``StartStateBounds reads URDF limits directly.

    Cleanest fix: widen the URDF that MoveIt reads.  The simulator keeps
    enforcing the original (slightly tighter) limit via its own joint
    classifier, and MoveIt sees a URDF whose limit is the sim limit + a
    small pad that absorbs the soft-constraint drift.  Pad magnitude is
    intentionally small (1.0e-2 rad ~ 0.57 deg revolute, 1.0e-3 m = 1 mm
    prismatic) so generated trajectories stay within the physical range
    -- this is a tolerance widening, not a limit relax.

    Both ``revolute`` and ``continuous`` joints are skipped if the
    declared range is already 2*pi or wider (a continuous joint's URDF
    may carry placeholder limits but is effectively unlimited).

    Returns the URDF string unchanged if XML parsing fails -- better to
    surface that as a launch error downstream than to half-edit the XML.

    """Insert ``base_footprint`` and a passive prismatic Z joint above ``base_link``.

    Why: MoveIt's planar virtual_joint stores only (x, y, theta); base_link's
    z is forced to 0 in RobotState.  We need MoveIt's view of base_link to
    track the simulator's actual ride height (chassis bobbing, traversing
    a small platform, wheel deformation) so that collision-relative-to-
    world-frame manipulation is consistent.

    Without modifying the canonical URDF that the simulator's assemble
    pipeline consumes, this helper rewrites the MoveIt-side URDF string
    at launch time to insert a synthetic chain::

        odom (planar virtual_joint, x/y/theta)
         -> base_footprint  (massless link, ground-projected)
         -> base_link       (real chassis link, was attached to odom directly)
              via prismatic joint along z

    The simulator publishes the prismatic joint's value on ``/joint_states``
    each tick (= ``body_q[base_link].z``), so RSP applies the live ride
    height to MoveIt's RobotState transparently.  The SRDF marks the joint
    as ``<passive_joint>`` so the planner never tries to vary z.

    The simulator never sees ``base_footprint`` or the prismatic joint --
    its URDF / robot.usda is untouched.  This is purely a MoveIt-side
    re-parenting hack, applied via the same launch-time mutation pattern
    as :func:`pad_urdf_joint_limits`.

    Idempotent: if ``base_footprint`` is already in the URDF (e.g. somebody
    later promotes it into the canonical xacro), this is a no-op.

    Returns the URDF string unchanged if XML parsing fails or
    ``base_link`` isn't found -- better to surface that as a launch error
    downstream than to half-edit the XML.
